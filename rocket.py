#Maybe in the future we will control and manipulate rockets and satellites with our linux terminals with the right hardware and materials
#The Rocket class requires two drag curves, one for when the motor is off and one for when the motor is on.

#Pay special attention to the following:
#mass is the rocketâ€™s mass, without the motor, in kg.
#inertia is defined as a tuple of the form (I11, I22, I33). Where I11 and I22 are the inertia of the mass around the perpendicular axes to the rocket, 
#and I33 is the inertia around the rocket center axis.
#Alternatively, inertia can be defined as a tuple of the form (I11, I22, I33, I12, I13, I23). 
#Where I12, I13 and I23 are the component of the inertia tensor in the directions 12, 13 and 23 respectively.
#center_of_mass_without_motor and coordinate_system_orientation are position parameters. They must be treated with care.
