# Aerospace-objects
This repository contains analytical material to solve some problems with satellites and orbits. 

Definition:
In order to create new robotics spaceships and satellites we need to understand the motor,s dynamics and robotic kinematics for motion.

PROJECT-STRUCTURE#

-Motors-Aerospace propulsion

-Sensors cpp robots in c++

-Liquid_Motor(Thermodynamics)

-RODOS for aerospace terminals(static analysis of kernels CPU) for satellites

Pay special attention to the flux_time, liquid_mass_flow_rate_in, liquid_mass_flow_rate_out, gas_mass_flow_rate_in and gas_mass_flow_rate_out parameters.
