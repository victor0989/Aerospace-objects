# Aerospace-objects
This repository contains analytical material to solve some problems with satellites and orbits.
RODOS and ROS for sensors in c++ that are used in robotics industry and aerospace. To configure structural robotics inside the rockets and the satellites we need to take in consideration apart from the aerodynamics systems, the nucleus in RODOS, ROS
and c++ signals, we need also dns signals and satellite signals for aerospace projects and test with a debugger or strace the
memory and the pointers of our satellite-sensors and server-signals for robotic systems and aerospace research.

Definition:
In order to create new robotics spaceships and satellites we need to understand the motor,s dynamics and robotic kinematics for motion.

PROJECT-STRUCTURE#

-Motors-Aerospace propulsion

-Sensors cpp robots in c++

-Liquid_Motor(Thermodynamics)

-RODOS for aerospace terminals(static analysis of kernels CPU) for satellites

Pay special attention to the flux_time, liquid_mass_flow_rate_in, liquid_mass_flow_rate_out, gas_mass_flow_rate_in and gas_mass_flow_rate_out parameters.
