# Aerospace-objects
This repository contains analytical material to solve some problems with satellites and orbits. 

Definition:
In order to create new robotics spaceships and satellites we need to understand the motor,s dynamics and robotic kinematics for motion.

-Motors-Aerospace propulsion
-Sensors cpp robots in c++
-Liquid_Motor(Thermodynamics)
-RODOS for aerospace terminals(static analysis of kernels CPU) for satellites
